# The Data Incubator Challenge
 This is my implementation for the challenge introduced by The Data Incubator when I was shortlisted in July 2019.
 
 The dataset used in the the notebook TDI-challenge is from <https://data.baltimorecity.gov/Transportation/Parking-Citations/n4ma-fj3m? 
 
 The second file is implementation of breadth-first search algorithm for knights moving on nxn grid for a goal to move from point to point.
